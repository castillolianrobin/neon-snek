Basic implementation of classic snake game. The logic is not a clone of other code so the code is currently messy. MVP hasn't been reached yet.


<br>

The following updates will be in the next push
- Fix: Game not working upon pressing play again
- Fix: Quick movement cause the game over
- Fix: Pause doesnt stop snake food from spawning
- Update: Home screen with main menu
- Update: Mobile responsiveness from phone device
- Feature: Mobile screen control
